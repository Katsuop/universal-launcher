# Universal Launcher

> A Minecraft launcher to create modpacks and destroy all the others launchers.
 
To make it simple, this project will be a minecraft launcher made with C++ and Qt5.
The original idea is to be a replacement for every Minecraft launchers already existing.

I mean, at the moment, lot of Minecraft server (most of the time from the French community) have their own
launcher. So 1 launcher mean 1 server. It can't just continue, players have to download a new launcher on
their computer each time they want to switch server.

This is the goal of this project, unify all minecraft launcher into one.


> :warning: **This project is still at an experimental state.** You will have to compile it by yourself if you want
> try it.
